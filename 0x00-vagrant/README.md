Git is installed on the iMacs provided by Holberton, but if youre using another computer, you might have to [install it](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/TJrA7MIEl9LxnkGNH_ddmw) yourself.
- Configure your basic info (name, email) on your local machine  they will be part of your commits. [Tips](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/72jmwYpf2OeuoOn9XM3vQg)
On [GitHub.com](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/m27bKy8K40cIkyHWQ36i2w):
- Using the graphic interface on the website, create your first repository
  - Name: ``holbertonschool-zero_day``
  - Description: ``I'm now a Holberton Student, this is my first repository as a full-stack engineer``
  - Public repo
  - No ``README``, ``.gitignore``, or license

On your computer, open a terminal and do the following:
- Navigate to your home directory. [Tips](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/-odz94uVNOsPV1ovYZLuyw)
- Create a directory holbertonschool-zero_day. [Tips](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/AHYBfU0itf9qEiwLdiaVJw)
- Navigate to this new directory. [Tips](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/9g9c-qBPHWSGcpxbs69ASw)
- Initialize git and add the remote origin
- Create a file ``README.md`` with Emacs (or other command line editors) and write a small [Markdown](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/Ru3ANLuzGs4g0v2qsN3efA) text to present this project. **This file is mandatory in all Holberton School projects**
- Add this new file to git, commit the change with this message "My first commit" and push to the remote server / origin (Note: You will probably need to set your login/password to push to the remote server)
